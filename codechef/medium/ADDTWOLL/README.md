## Problem

### Add Two Numbers (Linked List)

You are given two linked lists that represent two non-negative numbers.
Each number’s digits are stored in  **reverse order**, and every node contains  **a single digit**.

You need to  **add both numbers**  and print the  **resulting linked list**  (also in reverse order).

 **Leading zeros are considered as the nodes because the node's data value can be 0.** 

### Function Declaration
### Function Name

$addTwoNumbers$ – This function adds two non-negative integers represented by two singly linked lists.
Each linked list stores digits in  **reverse order**, where each node contains a single digit (0–9).

The function must compute the sum and return the resulting linked list, also in reverse order.

### Parameters
- $l1$ : A pointer to the head of the first linked list.
- $l2$ : A pointer to the head of the second linked list.
### Return Value
- Returns the head of a new linked list representing the sum of the two numbers.
- Each node contains a single digit.
- If there is a carry after the last digit, an extra node is appended.
## Constraints
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range $[1, 100]$.
- $0 \leq \text{Node.data} \leq 9$
### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N1$ — the number of nodes in the first linked list.
- The second line contains $N1$ space-separated integers representing the digits of the first number (in reverse order).
- The third line contains an integer $N2$ — the number of nodes in the second linked list.
- The fourth line contains $N2$ space-separated integers representing the digits of the second number (in reverse order).
### Output Format
- Print the resulting linked list representing the sum, with digits separated by spaces.
- The output list must also be in reverse order.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 9 9 9
3
5 0 0

```

```
0 0 0 0 1

```

### Explanation:

First number $\rightarrow$ 9995
Second number $\rightarrow$ 5 0 0 $\rightarrow$ 005
Sum = 9995 + 5 = 10000
In reverse order $\rightarrow$ `0 0 0 0 1`

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
2
9 9
3
1 0 1

```

```
0 0 2

```

### Explanation:

First number $\rightarrow$ 99
Second number $\rightarrow$ 101
Sum = 200
Reverse $\rightarrow$ `0 0 2`

```java
//class Node {
//    int data;
//    Node next;
//    Node(int data) {
//        this.data = data;
//        this.next = null;
//    }
//}

public static Node addTwoNumbers(Node l1, Node l2) {
    Node dummy = new Node(0);
    Node current = dummy;
    int carry = 0;
    
    while(l1!=null || l2!=null || carry!=0){
        int sum = carry ;
        if(l1!=null){
            sum +=l1.data;
            l1 = l1.next;
        }
        if(l2!=null){
            sum +=l2.data;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        carry = sum/10;
        current.next = new Node(sum%10);
        current = current.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
}

```
